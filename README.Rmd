<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of binomialOptions is to be able to valuate binomial options using the Cox, Ross and Rubinstein adaptation of OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND OTHER DERIVATIVES book from John C. Hull

To run the application:

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::restore()
rhino::app()
```
